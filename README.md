### INTRODUCTION


Ron and his buddies founded Foodie-Fi and began selling monthly and annual 
subscriptions, providing clients with unrestricted on-demand access to exclusive cuisine 
videos from around the world.

This case study focuses on the use of subscription-style digital data to answer critical 
business questions about the customer journey, payments, and business performance.
